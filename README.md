# Natural Disaster Prediction System


# Problem Statement
Data has shown that the occurrence of these natural disasters is increasing in frequency, growing approximately 350% between 1990 and 2010. 
The number of natural disasters has increased by 350% from 1990 to 2010 and the number of natural disasters will continue to grow. In 2020, 980 natural disasters caused over 8000 deaths and USD 210 billions in overall losses. We explore if we can predict natural disaster.

### IBM Z Cloud Community
* Python code (file: FinalNaturalDisasterPredictionModel.ipynb) created in Python locally. 
* With IBM Z Analytics instance, data file and Python source code were uploaded successfully. 
* Python code was modified accordingly to run on IBM Z's Jupyter Python notebook, hence the discrepancy of some elements such as visualization of bar charts. 
* Random Forest models were trained and tested. Hyper-parameters tuning was implemented to tackle overfitting of final model.
