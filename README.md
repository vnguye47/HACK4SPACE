IBM Z Cloud Community
Python code (file: FinalNaturalDisasterPredictionModel.ipynb) created in Python locally. 
With IBM Z Analytics instance, data file and Python source code were uploaded successfully. 
Python code was modified accordingly to run on IBM Z's Jupyter Python notebook, hence the discrepancy of some elements such as visualization of bar charts. 
Random Forest models were trained and tested. Hyper-parameters tuning was implemented to tackle overfitting of final model.
